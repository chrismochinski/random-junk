//THIS IS MY 'WORD OF THE DAY' FILE
//I'll use this to keep track of terms I find interesting.
//----------------------------------------------------
        //WEEK-1------------------------

    //CONCATENATE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//link things together in a chain or series
//"some words may be concatenated, such that certain sounds are omitted"

//----------------------------------------------------

        //WEEK-2------------------------

    //DELINEATE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//describe or portray something precisely
//"the law shoud delineate and prohibit behavior that is socially abhorrent"
//OR - to indicate the exact position of (a border or boundary)

//----------------------------------------------------

        //WEEK-3-------------------------

    //INSTANTIATE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//represent as or by an instance
//"a study of two groups who seemed to instantiate productive aspects of this"
//
    //C.L.I. (no dots)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//"Command Line Interface" - should probably figure out if this term is common

    //----------------------------------------------------

            //WEEK-5-------------------------

    // COMPOUND CONDITIONAL ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//uses OR which is || in the syntax

    //PARSE / PARSING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/* To parse is to break up a sentence or group of words into
separate components, including the definition of each part's
function or form. ... Parsing is used in all high-level
programming languages. Languages like C++ and Java are parsed
by their respective compilers before being transformed
into executable machine code.
*/

    //NaN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//'Not A Number'
//Used to denote that the value of an object is NOT a number

    //null ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//object is empty and isn't pointing to any memory address
//exits but has been deliberately been given an empty value

    //undefined ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//The object doesn' thave any value, therefore undefined.
//When you create a variable but don't assign a value to it.
//Exists but hasn't been given a value...yet

    //ARROW FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/* These are NOT to be used yet
This is a compact alternative to traditional function expressions,
but is limited and cannot be used in all situations

-Does not have its own bindings to this or super, and should not be used as methods.
-Does not have new.target keyword.
-Not suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
-Can not be used as constructors.
-Can not use yield, within its body.

example............

// Traditional Function
function (a){
  return a + 100;
}

// Arrow Function Break Down

// 1. Remove the word "function" and place arrow between the argument and opening body bracket
(a) => {
  return a + 100;
}

// 2. Remove the body braces and word "return" -- the return is implied.
(a) => a + 100;

// 3. Remove the argument parentheses
a => a + 100;

    //Boilerplate code ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/*boilerplate code or just boilerplate are sections of code
that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation.
When using languages that are considered verbose, the programmer
must write a lot of code to accomplish only minor functionality.
Such code is called boilerplate

The term arose from the newspaper business. Columns and other pieces
that were distributed by print syndicates were sent to subscribing
newspapers in the form of prepared printing plates. Because of their
resemblance to the metal plates used in the making of boilers, they
became known as "boiler plates", and their resulting text -
"boilerplate text". As the stories that were distributed by boiler
plates were usually "fillers" rather than "serious" news, the term
became synonymous with unoriginal, repeated text.
*/

    //TEMPLATE LITERALS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/*String literals allowing embedded expressions.
You can use multi-line strings and interpolation features
Enclose in backtick and curly braces (${expression})

`string text`

`string text line 1
 string text line 2`

`string text ${expression} string text`

tag`string text ${expression} string text`

To escape a backtick in a template literal, put a backslash (\) before the backtick.

`\`` === '`' // --> true
