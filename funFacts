//FILE OF FUN TERMS AND RANDOM CODE LEARNING

// CLI = "Command Line Interface" - another term for "terminal," I guess!

// using CMD + / it comments out the whole line - don't even need to select!

// use in command line-  file filename.jpg  - to get file info like dim, etc

// get WiFi pass via terminal:
// security find-generic-password -ga IWantMyHatBack
// (...or whatever network)

// MOVE SOMETHING IN TERMINAL:
// simply use mv
// if moving in same/simiar directory, might need to practice
// mv index.html NEWFOLDER - simple as that!
